## Hi there , this is krisha thapaðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a computer science student at CUNY-Queens College,diving deep into the world of code and algorithms.
- ðŸŒ± Right now, I'm mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ and getting hands-on with Computer Assembly Language.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on on projects that solve real-world problems or just fun, creative ideas! Got a project in mind? Letâ€™s team up and make it happen.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always eager to learn from others. If you have tips on advanced C++ concepts, Assembly Language hacks, or just want to share your coding journey
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my favorite coding projects. How I stay motivated when debugging feels like a never-ending maze. My thoughts on the future of tech and AI.

- âš¡ Fun fact:
 --> I have a secret passion for cooking! When I am not coding, I am experimenting in the kitchenâ€”whether cooking homemade desi foods.
     Turns out, coding and cooking have a lot in common: both require precision, creativity, and a willingness to learn from your mistakes.

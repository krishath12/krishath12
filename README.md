## Hi there , this is krisha thapaðŸ‘‹
 
 Iâ€™m a junior studying Computer Science, and this is where I drop my code, side projects, and experiments â€” the wins, the work-in-progress stuff, and everything in between.
 I started programming a few years ago, mostly through classes and curiosity, and Iâ€™ve been hooked ever since. Iâ€™ve worked with Python, Java, and C++ (yep, the classics), and Iâ€™m     
 always trying to level up my skills by building things that are actually useful or just plain fun.
 Most of what youâ€™ll find here are things Iâ€™ve built for school, personal learning, or just to see if I could (looking at you, random CLI tools and half-finished web apps). Iâ€™m really 
 into solving problems, understanding how stuff works under the hood, and making projects that feel like they mean something.

Right now, Iâ€™m focused on:

Writing cleaner, more readable code, getting better at algorithms and data structures, learning more about backend dev and system design.

Tools I usually mess with:

Python, Java, C++, Git/GitHub (slowly mastering the art of good commits),VS Code, Linux, basic web dev (HTML/CSS/JS), SQL, and whatever Iâ€™m curious about that week.

Iâ€™m still figuring it all out, but Iâ€™m proud of how far Iâ€™ve come. Always open to feedback, collabs, or just connecting with other devs who are learning too.

Thanks for checking out my GitHub. Letâ€™s keep building cool things ðŸš€
